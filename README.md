Hi 👋 . I'm Christopher. Born and raised in the concrete jungle known as Queens, NY 🇩🇴 .

Growing up data was all around me, whether it was tracking my pitching stats in high school or helping autistic children improve their skills with daily data collection. 
I realized early on that data its very own language and was only going to continue to grow at a rapid pace 📈 .

Currently looking for a data scientist position were I can take my skills to the next level! 🤙🏻
